## Development

### Environment setup

To set up your environment to develop this theme, clone this repo and install the dev dependancies:
```bash
$ bundle install
```

```bash
$ npm install
```

You theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

### Tests

To run tests on SCSS and HTML run:

```bash
$ script/test
```

### Releases

To prepare bundle a new version of the Gem:

- Rev the version number in `package.json`
- Rev the version number in `stately-jekyll.gemspec`
- Update the `CHANGELOG.md`
- Run the build script

```bash
$ script/build
```
