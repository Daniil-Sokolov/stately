# Configuration
{:.no_toc}

<p class="text-intro" markdown="1">Out of the box, Stately comes with a few options to configure your site. All site-wide configuration options are customized by editing your siteâ€™s `_config.yml` file.</p>

## Default configuration

In addition to the standard Jekyll configuration variables, Stately provides a few extras for various customizations you may want to make. Here is the default configuration that comes with a fresh install of Stately:

<div class="code-example border rounded-1">

{% highlight yaml %}

## Stately settings
nav_logo_file: assets/images/stately-logo.png # path to the logo file (supports svg, png, jpg, gif). Delete this line for no logo.
github_link: true # Display link to edit page content on GitHub
github_pages_branch: master # Branch where gh-pages site is hosted (either master, master/docs, or gh-pages)

## Info bar settings
# info_bar: true # Bar at the top of all pages.
# info_bar_text: This is not an offical site of the <a href="//usa.gov" class="text-white text-underline">U.S. Government</a>
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

The variables in the Info bar section have been commented out so that the info bar UI component is not displayed by default.
